EVERYTHING ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND THE USE OF THE METHODS CAN BE FOUND IN THE REPORT

----    Euler   ----
·The first input is the function y'
    It cannot contain any variable beyond 'y' and 't'
    Functions of the math library should have the prefix math.
    Any float number in the function should be written like a parameter of Decimal()
    Examples of inputs can be found in the report.pdf
·The second input is the y0
·The third input is the t0
·The fourth input is an option the user has
    It can only be 1, 2 or 3, anything else will make the code end with exit 1
·The following inputs depends of the option chosen
    If the option chosen was 1, the next two inputs will be the height and the number of steps
    If the option chosen was 2, the next two inputs will be the height and the tf
    If the option chosen was 3, the next two inputs will be the number of steps and the tf

·The output is going to be the y(tf) and the graph of y

·The seventh input is for the user to choose the order of the method
    It can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 anything else will make the code end with exit 1
·The following inputs depends of the order chosen
    If the option chosen was 1, it won't be necessary any other input
    If the option chosen was 2, the next input will be the y1
    If the option chosen was 3, the next two inputs will be the y1 and y2
    If the option chosen was 4, the next three inputs will be the y1, y2 and y3
    If the option chosen was 5, the next four inputs will be the y1, y2, y3 and y4
    If the option chosen was 6, the next five inputs will be the y1, y2, y3, y4 and y5
